# Summary Generation Fixes - Version 2

## Issue Identified
The error "JSON object requested, multiple (or no) rows returned" was caused by using `.single()` in the Supabase query, which expects exactly one row but fails if the note doesn't exist or if there are data integrity issues.

## Root Cause
- The API was using `.single()` which throws an error if zero or multiple rows are returned
- No proper error handling for missing notes
- Frontend had no way to distinguish between different types of failures

## Fixes Applied

### 1. API Endpoint Improvements (`app/api/notes/[id]/route.ts`)
- **Removed `.single()`**: Changed from `.single()` to regular query and manually check results
- **Better Error Handling**: Distinguish between "note not found" (404) and other errors
- **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed logging to track note fetching
- **Proper Response Codes**: Return 404 for missing notes instead of 500

### 2. Frontend Error Handling (`app/components/SupabasePatientNotes.tsx`)
- **404 Handling**: Don't retry when note doesn't exist (404 error)
- **Debug Button**: Added debug button next to failed summaries
- **Better Error Messages**: More specific error handling for different scenarios

### 3. Debug Tools
- **Debug Endpoint**: Created `/api/notes/debug/[id]` to check note existence and status
- **Easy Access**: Debug button in UI opens debug info in new tab

### 4. Testing Commands
```bash
# Check overall summary status
curl http://localhost:3000/api/notes/summary-status

# Debug specific problematic note
curl http://localhost:3000/api/notes/debug/9bcabdaa-b3c5-424a-a625-ef500605cf21

# Generate missing summaries
npm run supabase:generate-summaries
```

## Expected Behavior Now

1. **Existing Notes**: Should generate summaries successfully
2. **Missing Notes**: Will show "Summary generation failed" with proper error logging
3. **Debug Info**: Click "Debug" button to see detailed note information
4. **No More Infinite Loading**: Failed notes won't get stuck in loading state

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Debug Endpoint**: Use the curl command above to check if the problematic note exists
2. **Check Browser Console**: Look for more specific error messages
3. **Use Debug Button**: Click debug buttons in UI for detailed information
4. **Verify Note Existence**: Ensure notes exist in Supabase database

## Data Integrity Check

If notes are missing from the database but showing in the frontend, there might be a sync issue between the frontend cache and the database. The debug endpoint will help identify these cases.
